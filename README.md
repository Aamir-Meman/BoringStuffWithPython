# Boring Stuff With Python
This is a repository only for learning python and automate boring stuff in daily life.

**You'll remember the things you do much better than the things you only read.**

## Expressions
- 2 + 2

Expressions consist of **values** (such as 2) and **operators** (such as +), and they can evaluate down to a single value.

## Precedence

The ** operator is evaluated first; the ***, /, //, and %** are evaluted next, from left to right; and the + and - operators are evaluated last (also from left to right). You can use parentheses to override the usual precedence if you need to.

## The Integer, Floating-Point, and String Data Types

- A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type.
- The integer (or int) data type indicates values that are whole numbers.
- Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14 are called floating point numbers (or floats).
- Always surround your string in **single quote (')**
- You can even have a string with no characters in it. **''** called a **blank string**.

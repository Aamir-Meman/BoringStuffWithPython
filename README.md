# Boring Stuff With Python
This is a repository only for learning python and automate boring stuff in daily life.

**You'll remember the things you do much better than the things you only read.**

## Expressions
- 2 + 2

Expressions consist of **values** (such as 2) and **operators** (such as +), and they can evaluate down to a single value.

## Precedence

The ** operator is evaluated first; the ***, /, //, and %** are evaluted next, from left to right; and the + and - operators are evaluated last (also from left to right). You can use parentheses to override the usual precedence if you need to.
